Welcome to my page! 

My name is Nick and I'm a martia... a ner... well, I'm kind of bad at these things. I am creating this site to commemorate the Data Sciene course that I am taking through [Lambda](https://Lambdaschool.com). I have a BA in Philosophy, an interest in Maths and I tend to focus on the Philosophy of Science. That being said, a lot of what I want to do involved quantitative analysis of large systems, so Data Science is a focus for me. I will be posting blogs here quite frequently, the first being: [Is Cognitive Function Theory valid?](https://medium.com/@nickmajor/why-mbti-is-wrong-a-dive-into-cognitive-function-theory-eb3f60361663). Check back for further entries!
